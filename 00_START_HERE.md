## 💡 KEY IMPROVEMENTS EXPLAINED

### 1. TypeScript Strict Mode
**What changed**: `strict: false` → `strict: true`
**Why**: Catches more errors at compile time
**Benefit**: Fewer bugs in production

### 2. ESLint Enforcement
**What changed**: `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` → `false`
**Why**: Forces code quality standards
**Benefit**: Cleaner, more maintainable code

### 3. Security Headers
**What added**: Middleware with 4 security headers
**Why**: Prevents common web vulnerabilities
**Benefit**: Safer application for users

### 4. JSON-LD Schemas
**What added**: 12 schema generators
**Why**: Helps search engines understand content
**Benefit**: Better ranking, rich snippets

### 5. Middleware
**What added**: src/middleware.ts
